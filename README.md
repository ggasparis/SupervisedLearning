# Supervised Learning project

Assignment as it was given from the [AILS](https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr)

Study for the classification of 2 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. One dataset is [small](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar%2C+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29) with less than 1000 samples and the other [large](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Nomao) with more than 1000 samples. 
 
### Objective 

With the exception of dummy classifiers, the objective is to find for every other classifier from each dataset:
* The optimal transformer architecture (pre-processing stages) 
* The optimal hyper-parameters (of both transformers and of the classifier) ​​via grid search and crossvalidation.
